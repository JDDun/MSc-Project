# MSc-Project
Image Processing / Hazard Mapping on GPU using CUDA.


# Summary
This program performs a hazard analysis for a simulated planetary terrain,
and from the generated hazard map selects the most appropriate landing sites.

Hazard mapping computation can be performed on either the CPU or GPU.

# Dependencies
- OpenCV 3.1
- PANGU (Planet and Asteroid Terrain Generation Utility)
- CUDA 7.5
- Fast Light Toolkit
